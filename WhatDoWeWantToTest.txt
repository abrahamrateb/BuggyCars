APIs - These seem to be the endpoints we'll be hitting, some of the are open/unauthenticated, and some of them can only be called if Authenticated
This means we need to get the bearer token, which for the case of this demo test, it a simple Password grant type flow
/prod/makes/ - GET
/prod/models/ - GET
/prod/models/{}/vote - POST - Authenticated
/prod/oauth/token - POST - Password flow
/prod/users/current - GET - Authenticated
/prod/users/profile - GET and PUT - Authenticated
